# React Telly
React Telly is a friendly little gif television to help you learn how to use, modify, and build components with React + TypeScript.

# Getting Started 

## Node.js configuration

We use NVM to control Node.js versions. If you don't already have NVM installed, [do so using the instructions from the NVM docs](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

## Available Scripts

You will want to make sure your node version matches the projects by running:
### `nvm use`

In the project directory, run:
### `yarn`
to install dependencies, then
### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

# Workshop set up
First, checkout a new branch off master and name it with your first and last name 

### `git checkout -b firstname-lastname`

You will do your work in that branch, and then push it up at the end of the session. If you'd like you can create a new commit for each of the numbered tasks below, but it's also fine to put them all in one big commit at the end.

You also need to set up credentials for the Giphy API. Here's how:
* Create a `.env` file in the root of the project. To do this you can either add a new file in your code editor or run `touch .env` in the terminal. On the first line of your new file, paste the following: `REACT_APP_GIPHY_API_KEY=`
* Make a [Giphy developer account](https://developers.giphy.com/)
* On the [dashboard page](https://developers.giphy.com/dashboard/?), select "Create an App." Choose the free "API" option, then give your app a name and description. Once you have created the project, copy the API key.
* paste the key into your `.env` file right after the equal sign in `REACT_APP_GIPHY_API_KEY=`
* stop your development server by hitting `control` + `c` in the terminal window where your server is running, then run `yarn start` to restart it
* Note: if you are having issues making API calls and see a `Request Header Or Cookie Too Large` error in the response, clear you browser cookies and restart your server

# Workshop Goals

## 1. Render the `Button` component in the `HomePage` component and make the button log something to the console
### Stretch goals:
* give the button `hover` and `focus` state styles
## 2. Now update the button so that when it is clicked, a random gif renders in the `GifViewer` component
* To do this, you will need to 
* fetch data via the `useGif` hook, which is already imported into the `HomePage` component. `fetchNewGif` is the fetch function and `gif` is that data that is returned from the API.
### Stretch goals: 
* update the `title` of the `Button` so that it says `Start` until the first time it has been clicked, and then `Change the channel` after that
* add a loading state to the `GifViewer` component. As you can see, the `useGif` hook already has a `gifIsLoading` value to tell you when API data is in the process of being fetched
## 3. Now build a new component to display text. Add it to the `HomePage` so it displays the `title` of the gif underneath the `GifViewer`
